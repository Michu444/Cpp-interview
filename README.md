# INTERVIEW GAME


## Overview

Game called **INSTANCES WAR** created for interview.

Due to the lack of an insufficient amount of free time (studies, work) I was unable to implement the game exactly as 
it is presented in the instructions.

<br/>


I am aware that the game still needs a lot of refinement.

I hope that my current implementation of the game at least to a lesser extent qualifies for recruitment.

I failed to implement:

- Reading settings from files (map.txt, orders.txt and status.txt)
- Most unit tests
- Mediator program
- The mechanism of collecting gold from the mine by workers
- ID system for each character and building
- GUI interface


Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the recruitment process for the position of Junior C++ Developer!
